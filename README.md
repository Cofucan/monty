# monty
This is repo for the ALX SE project `C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO`, where we practice stacks and queues data structures using C and the Monty language.

## The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

## Compilation & Output
The code will be compiled this way:
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
